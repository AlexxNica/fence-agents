.SH NAME
fence_zvmip - Power Fencing agent for GFS on System z z/VM Clusters using IP interface to SMAPI

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_zvmip
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_zvmip is a Power Fencing agent used on a GFS virtual machine in a System z z/VM cluster.
It uses the TCP/IP SMAPI interface to recycle an active image.

fence_zvmip accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.
fence_node sends the options through stdin when it execs the agent.
fence_zvmip can be run by itself with command line options which is useful
for testing.

.SH NOTES
To use this agent the z/VM SMAPI service needs to be configured to allow the virtual
machine running this agent to connect to it and issue the image_recycle operation.
This involves updating the VSMWORK1 AUTHLIST VMSYS:VSMWORK1. file. The entry should look
something similar to this:

.nf
Column 1                   Column 66                Column 131
|                          |                        |
V                          V                        V
XXXXXXXX                   ALL                      IMAGE_OPERATIONS
.fi

Where XXXXXXX is the name of the virtual machine used in the authuser field of the request.
